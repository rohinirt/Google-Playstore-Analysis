## Objective
With millions of apps available on the Google Play Store, understanding app performance through ratings, reviews, and installations is vital for developers, marketers, and business analysts.

This analysis answers questions such as:

Do more reviews correlate with better ratings?

Which genres receive the highest number of reviews?

Which Android versions support the most apps?

What are the most installed and reviewed apps?
